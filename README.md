# step-by-step-multi-sensor-fusion

<<<<<<< HEAD
The aim is to build a multiple-sensor localization and mapping platform based on the unused sensors in our lab. This repo will cover the contents about sensor assembling, sensor driver, calibration, dataset recording, and a naive mutilple-sensor localization system.

## Sensor assembling

After checking the device list in our lab, I found four sensors to assemble a multi-sensor platform.
1. VLP-16.
2. Realsense D435
3. Xsens MTI-710
4. u-blox M8T
